##  CRAP Principles
Contrast
In the design of my site, the principle of contrast was primarily applied to emphasize the most critical action elements, such as buttons and important messages. The form’s submit button, whether for login or signup, was given the most visual weight through its color contrast. For instance, I used a bold color, like green or red, to indicate success or failure when displaying messages in the messageDiv. This choice makes the feedback more prominent and easy to spot. Similarly, the color change between the login and signup button reinforces their current function, making it clear to users when they are in the signup versus login state. This intentional contrast draws the user’s eye to where the most important actions occur, helping them quickly understand the next steps they need to take.

Repetition
Throughout the design, I maintained a consistent use of repetition by employing similar fonts, layouts, and color schemes across different pages and components. This included using the same color palette for buttons, table layouts, and input fields. The form titles and buttons followed the same typography, giving the site a cohesive look and ensuring the user does not have to re-learn new visual elements when navigating through different sections like signup, login, and vehicle management. The repetition of layout structure, such as having input fields stacked in a vertical manner and the consistent positioning of action buttons like ‘Save’ and ‘Delete,’ creates a familiar experience for the user, reinforcing ease of use and intuitive interaction.

Alignment
For alignment, I made sure that all the elements, such as the input fields, labels, and buttons, were properly aligned to create a neat and organized visual structure. For instance, in both the login/signup forms and the vehicle management table, the input fields are aligned in a single column, which helps the user’s eyes follow a clear path from top to bottom. This alignment also adds to the professional and clean look of the site, reducing any clutter or confusion. In the table, the alignment of text within the editable fields and buttons is precise, giving the content a structured flow. It also helps create visual connections between related elements, like pairing action buttons with the data rows they modify.

Proximity
Lastly, the principle of proximity was used to group related elements together, making it easier for users to understand which actions or pieces of information are connected. For example, in the vehicle management form, input fields for model, year, and mpg are placed close together, clearly signaling that these fields are part of the same data entry for a single vehicle. Similarly, the save and delete buttons are positioned near the corresponding row of vehicle data, so the user intuitively knows which actions apply to which vehicle. Grouping the error or success messages near the form they belong to also reinforces this principle, as it immediately informs the user which form submission triggered the feedback, minimizing any potential confusion.
